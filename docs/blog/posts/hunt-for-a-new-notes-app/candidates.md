title: "Hunt for a New Notes App: Part 1 - Candidate Selection"
description: I evaluate 47 note apps to identify which ones I should try.

![](./assets/candidates-cover.png)

I am once again giving into the never-ending temptation to switch up the tools I use, and before so I'm evaluating a massive list of notes options to identify my options, before committing to spending at least a week or two with each one that catches my eye.

<!-- more -->

At least this time, it's a _bit_ more of a necessary switch than previous times. I've been working with a massively inconsistent mismatch of apps for the past couple of years - I've got most stuff in Notion, a bunch of stuff in Logseq, and a bit of stuff in Obsidian, with no consistent rhyme or reason as to why it's split up like this. I want to pick one app and consolidate everything into it, so I'm not constantly switching.

## The Plan

Armed with an absolutely gigantic list of notes apps I assembled a couple of months ago from various places, I spent a few hours across a couple of days going through each one, evaluating it against a set of criteria, and just generally noting my initial thoughts based on things such as their site, screenshots, and community. The main requirements for the notes apps are:

- Sync service
    - I want to be able to access all my notes from any device, without manually syncing them
    - Raw files I can sync using Git is _not_ counted as a sync service - I want something that's fully automatic
- Web client
    - When I say I want to be able to access all my notes from any device, I also want that to include devices I don't have the ability to install arbitrary software on, so a web client is a must
- iOS client
    - Being able to take notes on the go is a must
- Linux client _(optional)_
    - Ideally I'd like to have a desktop client for the notes app, but this is not a hard requirement as long as there is a web client

Once I've gone through all the apps, I selected the few that caught my eye the most, and will be giving each of them a try for a period of time (at least a week or two) to see how they feel to use, and how well they fit into my workflow.

## Household Names

These are the apps that most people have likely heard of, and as a result require the least amount of explanation.

## Handwritten / Canvas-based

These are apps that are focused more on handwritten notes or a canvas-based approach to laying out notes, which does not interest me. As a result, these are all off the table immediately.

## How Did We Get Here?

I will readily admit - I have absolutely zero memory of where I sourced / collected this list of note apps from. As a result, there are some items on this list that make absolutely _zero_ sense to me. This is the catch-all category for anything that made me just ask myself how it ended up here.

## Evernote clones

Evernote is the classic example of a super successful notes app, and so it is no surprise that it has plenty of clones. These apps are categorized not based on being a direct clone / advertized replacement for Evernote, but rather based on having a workflow very reminiscent of Evernote.

That workflow is:

- A single, flat list of notes
- Each note is a single page
- Notes can be grouped using tags
- Notes can be grouped into notebooks

## Notion clones

Notion is (in my opinion) the closest thing to Evernote when it comes to level of popularity compared to Evernote's peak. As a result, it has obviously had wide-reaching influence on the notes app space, and so there are plenty of apps out there trying to take a chunk of Notion's market share. As with the Evernote clones, these are not necessarily direct clones of Notion, but rather apps that have a workflow very reminiscent of Notion.

That workflow is:

- Notes are pages
- Pages can contain other pages, leading to a much more customizable, user-defined organization hierarchy
- Pages contain "blocks" of content of various types, such as text, lists, tables, etc.

## Apple-only

If I were doing this research a year ago, these apps would be in the running, but due to my personal machine no longer being a Mac, these are all off the table.

## Chasing the New Hot Thing™

These are the apps who have made their whole design / business-model around the current hot thing - AI - to the point of (at least from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the app) making it near impossible to find out what the app actually does or how it works.

## Graph-based

Popularized by Roam Research, graph-based / Zettelkasten Method-inspired notes apps have experienced a massive surge in popularity and, as a result, a surge in the number of options. These are the apps that are focused on this workflow.
